You drop down, similar to how it's done in Hollow Knight, into a dark area. There's a crystal to your left that you can activate, you could also go right and venture down into a little cave/platform system. There's only a few things you can pick up: some random character boosters, maybe 1 offensive weapon item, and 1-3 tower tarot cards. You can place the tarot cards to summon towers similar to how you summon towers in Dungeon Defenders. You can go back to the starting crystal and activate it. The screen pans out and brittle walls break releasing monsters that all go for the crystal. Your towers fight off monsters while you can fight them off as well. After defeating all the monsters, a new level downwards opens up and there's more items to pick up like the start. This keeps going on as things get harder and harder. Every ten levels from level 5, there's a challenger. When you defeat them, they join your team. Every ten levels from level 10, there's a boss. There's a small crafting system to combine weapons into bigger weapons. There's 2 types of towers, passive towers that are a bit supportive (can still attack but do less damage) then the monsters pass because these are placed on the wall, and active towers that do great damage but can be broken by monsters, which you can scrap. This game is inspired by: The Binding of Isaac, Bloons Tower Defense, Dungeon Defenders, and Terraria. Because this is a roguelike game, when a player dies in singleplayer, everything starts over. In multiplayer, players can be revived after beating Challengers by sacrificing a tower. Health is recovered through pickups. Players have some permanent things, like permanent buffs for defeating certain bosses, skins, and crystals (some crystals have more defense/health, or special properties like being able to attack back). Waves are nonstop unless you sacrifice 10 currency units to the crystal. Continuous waves give more and better items. Emblems can be picked up to give stat-ups or special effects, but only 1 emblem can be held at a time. Near the crystal, there is an NPC who looks like a little demon. He wears sock puppets that act like other NPCs (guide puppet, buff puppet, etc.), while the actual demon lets you buy or sell items, as well as having a "Gacha Machine" that lets you roll 3 selected items for 3 new items, but it costs money. He also lets you sacrifice health for towers.

## Multiplayer Modes:
### Sabotage
You're divided into two teams, an escape team and an intelligence team. The purpose of the escape team is to go through puzzles, platforming, and exploration to escape dungeons. The intelligence team is assigned some service roles that do things like press buttons or activate things to help the escapees, but on both teams is a traitor. The traitor on the escape team can do things like not cooperate with team puzzles, but if they are sniffed out, they can be anonymously killed by the escape team through sabotage methods throughout the course, such as bounding them with temporary ropes and pushing them off ledges. The traitor on the service team can basically stall/troll the service team to seam incompetent, or can have cooldown abilities that screw over the service team, i.e. a power outage. The traitors win when the others can't escape, but lose when they can, and vice versa. Kinda inspired from Lethal Company and Among Us. Only problem is that it requires 6 players, but can be played with 5 or fewer players to just be on exploration team and someone is a traitor and the game has auto services.

### Malicide
Waves cannot be stopped (The first wave is started automatically). Only towers can be placed. There are no bosses, but Challengers may spawn within the normal area. More players spikes the difficulty proportionally. Items dropped are now shared between players. There are no drops during non-ending waves since waves cannot be stopped. Players who die cannot be resurrected, but their pets remain where they died and do their functions (dead players still earn rewards). Rewards are immense. Pets that attack can attack but have their damage reduced by 50%. Health is only recovered after waves are defeated (no health pickups).

### Co-op
Similar to main game. Difficulty spikes with more players. Items dropped are separate for each player (normal drops are the same, continuous wave drops are randomized and different for players). Players who die can only be resurrected after Challenges by sacrificing one tower/item per player that was dropped/made on the round the player died on. Players who are killed during challenges are dragged away and forced to kill off enemies, but the enemies to the killed players look like their teammates, so they may accidentally harm their teammates. Players who die on bosses are automatically revived the next round with no sacrifices needed

### Lore Elements
- Game is a "Rehabilitation Program" for the characters (prisoners) to "get a second chance at life as a defender." In reality, they are lab rats being tested on by the company, "Corban."
- when starting a random, players can customize their characters with pre-chosen settings but can't wear black and white striped shirts or all orange shirts cause those are depicted as criminals.
- In Co-op mode, players killed on challenger rounds get dragged away by mysterious NPCs with the same arm band showing an atom
- When you look at the crafted checklist, you can find tarot towers amongst everything else crafted, but they all say, "Patented" instead of a recipe
- Everyone wears animal heads except the company who wear white suits.
- The floors all have some fog that clouds the area
- Some items like soda cans can be spotted in backgrounds as you go further underground

### Notes
- Challengers are in a separate room, fun, chaotic, fast-paced
- Bosses happen in the main area, are slower but send many rounds. Still kinda chaotic but in a more manageable and microanalytical way
- There is one seed that is available separately from random seeds, this seed has the same drops, enemies, etc. for speedrun purposes, but the demon gacha machine is still randomized.
